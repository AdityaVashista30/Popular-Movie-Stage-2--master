## Project Overview


It is a multi-view app that supported the use of the internet to retrieve and send data using JSON objects. The app also supported customized designs and menu options (created using XML). 
The app retrieves data every time the app is opened and hence gives real-time updates whenever the app is reloaded. 
The app enables a user to select a movie from a grid view to see its details, ratings, review, and trailer.
The user can also sort/customize the displayed movies according to customized sorting.
